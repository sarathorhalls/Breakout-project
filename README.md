# Breakout-project

The first fully fledged java game development project I finished
developed in november of 2019

## Prerequisites

- Have version 11 of [Java SE Runtime](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html) installed.
- I'm not sure if images work at this moment on other operating systems than Windows because of hard coding file paths in windows format
- I recommend running this in VSCode.

## How to run

Run either with VSCode's built in code runner (by pressing F5 or the launch button in VSCode's Run and Debug menu)
or with this command in the root directoory:
```bash
javac Breakout.java
java Breakout
```
